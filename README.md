### Hi! :D

Howdy! :wave:   

My name is Pedro Chaparro and I'm currently a Research Investigator @ [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) :computer:.  
I'm also studying Computer Science in the same university :mortar_board:.

If you want to, don't hesitate to say hi! :smile:
